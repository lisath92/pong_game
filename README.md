# Pong Game

This is a ping pong game built on HTML5 canvas and using some starting JavaScript codes provided by the instructors. This is a project targeting our skills and knowledge in the new ES2015 syntax using classes. We created several classes to make up the game.

##Techniques Used

* **HTML5 Canvas** - In this project, this is the first time I have used a canvas and the basics have been easy to apply. However, I feel like there are more I need to brush up on to fully master it. 

* **JavaScript ES2015** - ES2015 has some signficant changes in syntax and functionality. In order to build our ping pong game, I created several classes to simulate specific parts of the game. For example, the paddles, ball and the game board. The basic set-up was provided during instruction times and we were provided detailed guidance in writing JavaScript codes.

* **Node.js and Webpack** - This is the first project that we had used Webpack on. It was easy to pick up on using Webpack build tool and I think I will continue using it as my first and foremost build tool. I used Node.js to install all the necessary packages as well as loaders for the whole building process.

##General Objectives Achieved
I enjoyed learning the new syntax and think it is very useful for future projects.
